# Tesla Guestbook

This is our submission for UofTHacks 2015. Tesla Guestbook is a webapp that is built with Mike Lee(the uber Tesla Driver)
The webapp allows the driver of a tesla to build up a guestbook of their various passengers throughout their time with Uber.

Node backend, angular frontend(to allow smoother transitions on Tesla's web browser)

#Setup

Make sure you add a file called config.js with the database credentials before running the app, or mongoose will not be very happy.
